title: Picture Notation, A Mnemonic System for Chess

I am slowly writing a book on how to apply memory techniques to chess. Its provisional title is *The Chess Memory Palace*. As it could be a long time before I complete the book, I am sharing chapter 1 now. This introduces **Picture Notation**, a method for writing chess moves as pictures. 

Picture notation is the simplest mnemonic system for chess that I know of. Most chess moves are notated with a single word. You can read it here: [Picture Notation: A Mnemonic System for Chess (PDF)](https://johnden.org/papers/picturenotation.pdf)

I am halfway through writing the rest of the book. I intend it to cover (a) a crash course on memory techniques, (b) how to create a branching memory palace, (c\) an example opening repertoire for White in the Schliemann Defence, (d) an example opening repertoire for Black in the Ruy Lopez Exchange, (e) how to memorise endgames, and (f) final thoughts such as how to use picture notation in other languages, and the importance of memory for chess.

For picture notation to be useful, you need to know how to memorise an image and how to structure your memories. I will explain these in the middle chapters of the book. Until then, look up [elaborative encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaborative_encoding) and the [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci). If you want to memorise an opening repertoire, you will have to adapt the journey method into a branching, rather than linear, structure.

I am also sharing the **appendix**, which lists picture words for all 64 squares.

Enjoy!
