On the copyright page of *The Chess Memory Palace*, you will find a decimal number (e.g. 1.9). This is the version number. As the book is available as print-on-demand and ebook, I am able to make small updates without doing a large print run.

This page lists the versions and the changes that have been made. All these changes are quite minor. If you are one of the early adopters with an early version, the minor errors should not affect your enjoyment of the book at all. And technically you have a limited edition copy!
