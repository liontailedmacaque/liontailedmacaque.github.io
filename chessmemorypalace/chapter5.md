This chapter presents a second example memory palace: a repertoire as Black against the Spanish (Ruy Lopez) Exchange: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6 cxc6 5.O-O.

Again I present a "pure main line" repertoire, playing Black's most popular move against every common try by White.

Before we begin I need to introduce transpositions and options for both colours. We deal with these using special features of the memory palace architecture: converging paths and ladders.
