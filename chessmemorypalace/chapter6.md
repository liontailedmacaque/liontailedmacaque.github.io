I have called this chapter a "bonus\" because I see the main use of *The Chess Memory Palace* method to be memorising openings. If you learn your opening repertoire in memory palaces, you can expect to use them every game, whereas theoretical endgames are quite rare. Endgame memory palaces are also trickier to use: you need to navigate to the starting position by yourself, many of them are a complex shape, and sometimes you need to "relabel the coordinates" on the board to deal with reflections.

On the other hand, with correct use of an endgame memory palace, you can be assured of playing these endgames perfectly. And endgame memory palaces do have one advantage over opening memory palaces: with an opening, it is not enough to learn the moves, you also need to study typical plans for where the game will go next (see Chapter [7](/chessmemorypalace/chapter7)) -- but with an endgame, you *can* build a memory palace without understanding the moves. It will take you to victory, whether you are a grandmaster or a beginner! So, if you are a true devotee of *The Chess Memory Palace* method, read on.

In the first half of this chapter, we adapt picture notation for endgames, and see how to deal with reflections. In the second half, I present six tree diagrams, ready for you to memorise. Some of these use advanced techniques which I will introduce as they arise.
