## Memory for the long term with spaced repetition

After some practice you will be able to build and memorise a memory palace quite quickly. This palace will serve you well for the next week or two, and your best images will remain with you effortlessly for a decade. But unless you review, most of the palace will gradually fade. This is okay if you wanted to learn a repertoire for a single game. But it is a problem if you wanted to retain the repertoire for the long term. After all, it's no fun to be halfway through a Najdorf and then discover you can't remember the image in your attic.

The good news is, your memories fade more slowly each time you review. So when you memorise a new image, at first you should review it frequently, but then you can wait for longer and longer intervals. (See Figure 7.1 if you like graphs.) You could review after an hour, then a day, then a week, then a month, then half a year...the precise best time intervals depend on the person, but the principle is the same for everyone. This is called **spaced repetition**.

![](/assets/chessmemorypalace/f7-1.png)

A review should test **active recall**. For a chess memory palace, this means asking "after passing the *shell* and *mime* at Waterloo Station entrance, what do I find at the information booth?"[^1] It is not enough to passively read your notes. You must ask yourself the question of what comes next, to practice the experience at the board. When you actively recall an image, spend a moment to visualise the scene and refresh all three interactions in the composite image (Chapter [2](/chessmemorypalace/chapter2)). This restores the memory to top condition, ready for your games. Like theatre, the image does not need to remain identical every time you review it. You can adjust and further exaggerate the movements or interactions, as long as you keep the core information intact.

If you recall both picture words in the right order, then your review is successful and you can wait longer before reviewing again. If your review is unsuccessful, review again tomorrow. This way, you will review the harder images more often than the easier images. For each unsuccessful review, investigate what went wrong using the guide in Chapter [1](/chessmemorypalace/chapter1). You may need to adjust and exaggerate the interactions to make them more memorable.

One of the best things about memory palaces is that you don't need any external help to review them. You can practise your chess repertoire while meditating with your eyes closed. However many of us like to use flashcards to prompt our reviews, as they handle the spaced repetition in a time-efficient way. Ideally you would review each image when you are just about to forget it: any earlier and the review is unnecessary, any later and you will need to spend longer recreating the image. People used to handwrite physical flashcards and use a filing system to manage the scheduling. These days of course, it's much easier with software. My favourite spaced repetition software (SRS) is the free and open source *Anki*. Other SRS programs are available too. The software will manage the scheduling for you, so you just need to create the flashcards and then truthfully answer "correct" or "fail" when you review.

You could review an entire memory palace in one go. This is worth doing before a game if you can predict which opening will be played. But for day-to-day flashcard practice, this is inefficient (not to mention off-putting) because you will be able to recall some images more easily than others. It's better to spend your time on the parts you find difficult, so I recommend creating one flashcard for each composite image.

On the front of each flashcard, I set the scene (Schliemann Transit Line), the location (information booth), and the previous composite image (*shell mime* at Waterloo entrance). I "tag" the card with the opening name (Schliemann) so that I can easily collate every card in the repertoire if I want to. On the back of each flashcard, I write the answer (*lore lore*). I write only the picture words because it takes too long to type out a full description of the composite image story. Save all that for your head.

For best practice, format the front of the card to use three different fonts so that your eye can recognise the different elements quickly. The most important trigger is your current location, so that should be written largest. Don't be tempted to add extra hints: you need to be able to replicate this at the board!

If the architecture of your memory palace is complicated, you may need some additional flashcards to remind yourself of the structure. For example, "What are the options after the passport control in the Spanish Exchange Airport?"[^2] Of course, it's better to keep your memory palace simple in the first place.

It can take a while to create your flashcards, but the results are very effective. (Also, be sure to read the software manual for tips on faster data input.) Once you get the hang of it, you can visualise your images and speed through the flashcard reviews rapidly.

Spaced repetition is an effective technique by itself, even without a memory palace. You could use it for chess moves without storing your moves in picture notation: just create a flashcard with a board position on the front and a chess move on the back. But memory palaces are a big improvement, because they use your brain's natural ability to remember places and stories. A good composite image is inherently more memorable than a chess move. This means your memories will last longer, your recall will be more accurate, and you will need to review less frequently. The combination of spaced repetition with a memory palace is incredibly powerful.

## Why memorise theory?

*The Chess Memory Palace* method raises some funny possibilities. You could examine a repertoire written in picture notation, like Figure 4.5 or Figure 5.7, memorise it completely, and then know the moves without ever having played them at the board. You could even write a computer script to generate the top engine move for all common lines in an opening, convert them automatically into picture notation, then memorise the tree diagram. You would carry a complete world class repertoire in your head, yet your moves would be equally surprising to you as to your opponent!

Is this a good idea? Of course not. Opening study is more than memorising moves. We need to know the typical middlegame strategies and tactics, and the typical endgames, so that we can continue to play a good game at the end of our memory palaces. We need to know the purpose behind the opening moves, so that we can exploit our opponents' mistakes if they exit our memory palaces unexpectedly early. And we need to know similarities to other openings, so that we can create analogous plans when we need to.

To quote GM Garry Kasparov, "Long before a player becomes a master he realises that rote memorization, however prodigious, is a far cry from understanding. He'll reach the end of his memory's rope and be on his own in a position he doesn't really understand.\"

I am reminded of the game Magnus Carlsen v Bu Xiangzhi, from the 2017 World Cup in Tbilisi.

![](/assets/chessmemorypalace/82.png)

Here, Bu played *pearl* (\...d5), sacrificing his pawn on e5 for a strong -- and eventually winning -- kingside attack. His plan clearly drew lessons from understanding the Marshall Gambit, despite Bu not being a regular Marshall player.

However, some authors go too far and claim that memory is unnecessary, as long as you understand your openings. The idea seems to be that if you truly, deeply understand a position, the moves will naturally flow out with no memory effort required. This is a mistake. There are two reasons why memory is vital.

First, of course, time pressure. In an exam, a talented student with a strong understanding of mathematics could derive the quadratic formula from scratch. But nobody does this. We memorise the formula instead, which saves time and mistakes when the clock is ticking. The same is true of chess moves.

After a year without review, GM Viswanathan Anand remembered only the smallest fragment of his World Championship preparation when he unexpectedly needed it against GM Levon Aronian (to win brilliantly at Wijk aan Zee 2013). Despite knowing the evaluation and a hint of his preparation, and doubtless understanding the position better than anyone else could, it still took him half an hour to re-calculate the right moves. For the rest of us it would have been impossible -- unless we could recall them from memory.

Second, there are different levels of "understanding", and we can often make more progress by using memorised moves as a reminder of our plans, rather than the other way around. In language, we all understand more words of our mother tongue than we use, or are even able to think of. Our "reading vocabulary" exceeds our "writing vocabulary". And yet, we do understand these words when we hear them. The sound of the word triggers our memory of what it means, even though we could not have generated the word ourselves. In the same way, we can read a move from a book or memory palace and then recall its purpose. ("*Five*? Oh of course, I play \...Kh8 here to make room for the knight on g8, then I can push the f-pawn!\") The move itself is a memory aid that triggers our understanding of the position. In other words, understanding and memory are complements, not substitutes.

As we improve, more and more of our moves will be played from a deep understanding of their purpose, without struggling to remember them. But this just pushes the limit of our deep understanding later into the game. There will always be marginal positions, just on the edge of our knowledge, where we don't understand the position deeply enough to reliably generate the best move -- and yet, after being told the move, we can remember exactly why it is important and why we should make it. To play a tactical line of the Schliemann purely from "understanding" rather than memory, you would need to know, understand, and evaluate all the variations. At some point the only practical option is just to memorise the moves.

To take this a step further, I could even argue that in practical play you need to understand the plan *going forward*, which is not the same as the purpose of the move *when you made it*. In the position below, from the Tartakower Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined, Black usually plays *leech* (\...Be6). On e6, the bishop still has prospects on the c8-h3 diagonal, while also supporting Black's queenside play.

![](/assets/chessmemorypalace/83.png)

But why did Black play \...b6 earlier? To make room for the light-squared bishop on b7! At the time, with more pieces on the board and more central tension, this made sense.

Do you need to know this? In one sense, yes. To understand the Queen's Gambit and its variations, especially when White deviates early, you need to understand your moves.

But practically speaking, no. If you can reliably get past this point in your games by memory, the important question is what purpose the pawn serves *now*: does it support c7-c5, or is it just a weakness? If a move creates a threat that never materialises, and your game progresses beyond the possibility of the threat, the past existence of the threat is no longer relevant.

This is particularly clear in tactical openings. Returning to the Schliemann, the Transit Line repertoire in Chapter [4](/chessmemorypalace/chapter4) navigated past several traps and potential blunders. Part of the purpose of White's moves was to avoid these tactics. Do you need to know what you avoided? Ideally, yes, that would improve your chess understanding. But we have limited time. At the margin, your time may be better spent analysing master games and typical endings, not over-analysing the early opening moves where you already played perfectly. Like following signposts through a swamp, if you can navigate to the end, you don't need to know what pitfalls you avoided. You need to know where to go next.

Ultimately, whether you agree with this last point or not, it is clear that players spend a lot of time memorising opening theory, yet frequently forget old analysis. Although Kasparov (correctly) emphasises understanding, he certainly wouldn't deny the value of a strong opening repertoire. In fact he played the Mieses Opening (*ram*, 1.d3) against the computer Deep Blue just to avoid its opening book.

So you need to memorise theory. The next question is, how? The traditional method is to drill moves from diagrams, perhaps with spaced repetition. Even masters can find this challenging, particularly when trying to learn many similar but different lines at once, when none of them have emotional salience (such as a painful loss). In this book I have advocated picture notation in a memory palace instead.

Which method is better? This is an empirical question, and there is only one answer that matters: the one that works best for *you*. Try both and see which creates the stronger memories. To my mind there is no doubt that, for most people, after a bit of practice, a memory palace is better for creating unambiguous memories that last.

I emphasise *unambiguous* because a lot of positions are frankly quite similar, especially when you haven't reviewed them for a long time. The two diagrams below are from different variations of the Italian Game. In one, GM Jan Gustaffson recommends \...Ba7, and in the other \...Bb6. Which is which? Even Gustaffson admits this is confusing!

![](/assets/chessmemorypalace/84.png)

After being told the move \...Bb6 or \...Ba7, I can recall its purpose, but it is hard to work out and be confident at the board. It is much easier using picture notation in a memory palace, when there is no similarity and no confusion.

To summarise, *The Chess Memory Palace* method does not replace your need for chess understanding. "After a while, I began to notice something", wrote GM Matthew Sadler after trying to win every game through the sharpest lines, "I was losing lots of games in 'unimportant variations'." Instead, *The Chess Memory Palace* method is like printing out your repertoire *in notation* and reading it at the board. It won't help you understand chess better, but it will let you play your prepared lines with perfect accuracy.

If you had your moves written on a physical sheet of paper, you would be disqualified for cheating. *The Chess Memory Palace* method lets you achieve this in your head.

## Blindfold simultaneous exhibitions

In this book we have practised converting picture notation to chess moves under pressure at the board (Chapter [1](/chessmemorypalace/chapter1)), and memorising chess moves as picture notation slowly at home (Chapters [2](/chessmemorypalace/chapter2) and [3](/chessmemorypalace/chapter3)). Another possibility is memorising chess moves as picture notation at the board while playing a game. This is harder because you can't refer to the Appendix while playing, so you need to know your list of picture words -- although after using picture notation for a while, you might accidentally learn most of them anyway.

Why would anyone want to do this? Because it would help with blindfold simultaneous exhibitions.

One of the key challenges of blindfold simuls is how to keep the games distinct. In other words, how can you remember which game is which? The earliest moves are often the hardest, because the games are still similar -- many identical -- before they each take a unique flavour in the middlegame.

For this reason, there is an intriguing history of exhibition strategies, as each master plans the simul in advance. Reuben Fine repeated a pattern of openings: 1.d4, 1.e4, 1.Nc3, 1.g3. Harry Pillsbury (who was a practitioner of memory techniques) preferred 1.e4, but used 1.d4 every few boards to create distinct groups of games. He also planned his second and third move replies to each 1.e4 e5 game. Alexander Alekhine had an even more elaborate system of planned openings, and requested his opponents announce their own moves so that he could use their voice as an additional identifying feature. George Koltanowski asked for 14 of the games to be announced in descriptive notation and the other 20 in algebraic notation. Miguel Najdorf took the black pieces in two of each set of 15 boards, in his 45 game exhibition.

All the strategies above can be planned before the exhibition begins. What about techniques to use during the exhibition, to record what the opponent has played? Tony Miles classified each common opening with a letter, then turned each set of five games into a word or sound. But the most advanced system was employed by Timur Garayev in his record 48 game exhibition. His strategy was to prepare an empty memory palace, then store the opening moves of each game as an image.

Compared to picture notation, Garayev's images are workable but not systematic. For example, 1.c4 e5 might be a crocodile with a giant ear (*c* and *e* representing the files), while 1.c4 c5 might be a two-headed crocodile (c file, symmetrical). Images like this can work for the first move or two, but I believe this technique can be improved with picture notation. Because picture notation can represent any move, the master would never have to invent new pictures while playing, and the images will never be ambiguous. Rather than storing only the very beginning of each game, a master could use picture notation to store the first four or five moves, and thus keep a huge number of games distinct. In theory, although it would be very slow and require highly skilled image building, you could memorise every move of every game in picture notation, and there would be no limit to the simultaneous exhibition except time!

## Other board games

A variant of picture notation should work for other boardgames with predictable branching (unlike go), such as draughts/checkers, mancala, jianggi, shogi, and xiangqi. It is surprising to me that memory techniques have rarely been applied to mind sports, where a strong memory gives a direct competitive edge.

## Picture notation in other languages

Picture notation as described in Chapter [1](/chessmemorypalace/chapter1) uses English words to convey information. The same principle will work in other languages, but might require some tweaks.

Each picture word (or phrase) needs to encode three items of information:

1.  **File** of the target square (eight options, a-h)

2.  **Rank** of the target square (eight options, 1-8)

3.  **Candidate piece** that moves to the target square (normally up to three options; sometimes four; and very rarely five, for target squares d2, d7, e2 and e7).

Picture notation in English achieves this using (1) the first consonant sound of a word, (2) the second consonant sound of a word, and (3) the number of syllables of a word. In other languages, it will often be possible to use consonant sounds for the file and rank, just like with English. Depending on the language, you may need to reassign which consonant sounds identify which ranks and files, to make sure there are enough words available for each square.

For choosing which candidate piece to move to the target square, using the number of syllables in a word will work for some languages, but not all. If necessary, use another property of a word, such as its grammatical gender or tone, but beware using anything that will vary too much in different dialects and accents, such as vowel sounds. If nothing is adequate, then you can transform the picture words into picture phrases. For example *toast* might indicate a1 with piece I, *toast covered in sticky oil* might indicate a1 with piece II, *toast on fire* might indicate a1 with piece III, and so on. You should avoid this if possible because it makes the composite images harder to remember, as each of them must contain four elements (two picture words plus two transformations) instead of two.

After you have created a system where any given picture word encodes the file, rank and candidate piece number, check that you have an available picture word for each of the 64 squares a1-h8, with candidate pieces I-IV. After that, you are ready to start memorising by placing composite images in a memory palace, exactly as before.

## Four complete games in picture notation

It may be helpful to see more examples of picture notation in action. Here are four games, three classic and one modern, with algebraic and picture notation side by side.

#### Game 1: Paul Morphy v NN, New Orleans 1858, 1-0

In this game note that 33.e8=Q -- a beautiful pawn promotion finish in a blindfold simultaneous exhibition -- is simply written as *wolf*. The pawn on e7 is candidate piece I, so we use a one-syllable picture word, and the promotion to a queen is assumed.

Note also that 29\...Qg7 and 30\...Qg8 use one-syllable picture words. If we forgot about checks, then the king would be candidate piece I and the queen would be candidate piece II. However, the king cannot legally move to g7 and g8 because that would put himself in check. Therefore the queen is candidate piece I and uses one-syllable picture words for these two moves.

## Summary of The Chess Memory Palace method

1.  **At home**, write out your repertoire (in a particular opening) as a tree diagram. Choose an appropriate setting, map locations onto the setting to match the shape of the tree, select picture words for each location, then memorise the palace.

2.  Keep your memories sharp with occasional review, perhaps using spaced repetition scheduling.

3.  **At the board**, play the first few moves using conventional chess memory.

4.  When you reach the starting position of one of your memory palaces, visualise the first composite image from memory. Translate the two picture words into chess moves. If your opponent plays the move you expected, play your prepared reply. (If you had memorised two or more options for your opponent, translate them all into chess moves, and then play the reply that matches your opponent's choice.)

5.  On each subsequent move, continue translating your memorised images into pairs of moves. Play your prepared moves, until your opponent leaves your repertoire.

6.  Now you have left your memorised preparation, confident you played the right moves. You should know (from conventional chess study) some typical plans. Good luck!
