This chapter presents an example memory palace. Beginning with the repertoire, I show how I would map the tree diagram onto a setting and memorise the composite images. This puts the theory from Chapters [2](/chessmemorypalace/chapter2) and [3](/chessmemorypalace/chapter3) into practice.

I have chosen a repertoire as White against the Schliemann Defence to the Ruy Lopez, which arises from 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5. I present a "pure main line" repertoire: playing White's most popular move against every common try by Black.
