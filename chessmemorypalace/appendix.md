title: Appendix - Picture Words for all 64 Squares
permalink: /chessmemorypalace/appendix

---

{% include chess-memory-header.html %}

This Appendix lists one-, two-, three-, and four-syllable picture words for all 64 squares. This covers all possible moves with candidate pieces I-IV. It also lists five-syllable picture words for d2, d7, e2 and e7, which are the only target squares that ever need five-syllable picture words in practice (for an early knight retreat).[^1]

You do *not* need to memorise this Appendix! This Appendix is a reference, for when you are sitting at home building your memory palaces. At the board, all you need to do is translate the picture words back into moves, as explained in Chapter [1](/chessmemorypalace/chapter1).

For each target square and number of syllables, I have written my favourite picture word in **bold**. I encourage the reader to use the words in bold, in the hope of building a community where we can share ready-made memory palaces that use the same picture words. But if you prefer an alternative picture word to my suggestion, do not hesitate to use it instead. The best picture word will depend on the associations you already have in your mind (Chapter [3](/chessmemorypalace/chapter3)).

Some mnemonists like to use people, rather than animals and objects, as picture words in their memory palaces. If this is you, I suggest going through the people (and fictional characters) you know, and writing their names as your preferred picture words.

A small handful of picture "words\" are actually two words, for example *roller coaster* as the four-syllable picture word for d5. The important thing is that these are one concept, one picture -- even though they are made of two words.

There are seven reserved words you should not use as picture words. *Pawn*, *king* and *queen* are reserved for specified piece moves in the endgame (Chapter [6](/chessmemorypalace/chapter6)); *rook*, *bishop* and *knight* are reserved for both underpromotions and specified piece moves (Chapters [1](/chessmemorypalace/chapter1) and [6](/chessmemorypalace/chapter6)); and *ladder* is reserved for special meanings in memory palace architecture (Chapters [5](/chessmemorypalace/chapter5) and [6](/chessmemorypalace/chapter6)).

[^1]: In the unlikely event that you move candidate piece V+ to a different target square, just take the one-syllable picture word and cover it with sticky oil, for example *toast covered in sticky oil* would be a move to a1 with candidate piece V. I have never needed to do this.
